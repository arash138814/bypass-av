# üõ°Ô∏è Advanced AV Evasion Techniques in C | Modern Malware Research Lab

> Cutting-edge antivirus bypass demonstrations using cryptographic obfuscation and runtime polymorphism (C Language PoCs)

This project contains simple proof-of-concept (PoC) examples in **C language** demonstrating how basic malware can evade modern antivirus detection. Tested against VirusTotal and various AV engines, these examples show how simple techniques can bypass signature-based and heuristic detection.

## üîê Shellcode Encryption Workflow (How to Use `XOREncrypt`)

- Before using `template5.c` or `template6.c`, you need to **encrypt your shellcode** with the `XOREncrypt()` helper function.
- If you are using GCC, all these files must be compiled with the `-z execstack` switch.

## üîç Techniques Covered
- Shellcode obfuscation and encoding
- XOR encryption to bypass static detection
