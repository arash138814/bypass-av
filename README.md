# 🔐 Antivirus Evasion Examples in C | Malware Obfuscation & Encryption Techniques

This project contains simple proof-of-concept (PoC) examples in **C language** demonstrating how basic malware can evade modern antivirus detection. Tested against VirusTotal and various AV engines, these examples show how simple techniques can bypass signature-based and heuristic detection.
